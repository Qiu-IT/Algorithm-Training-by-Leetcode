My solution of Algorithm in JS for next step to understand how to code in Front-end/Back-end with js. 

Almost all the Leetcode training runs under `https://www.programmercarl.com/` at Carl website. He offers us more details and how to think in Algorithm. In the folder Carl there are my solution (by myself) step by step **from** Array/LinkedList/HashTable/String/TwoPointers/Stack/ **to** Tree/Backtracking/DynamicProgramming/Greedy/ MonotonicStack.
